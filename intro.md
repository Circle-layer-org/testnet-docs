# Circle Layer Blockchain Smart Contract Platform


## Introduction to the Circle Layer Blockchain Platform
The Circle Layer Blockchain Platform is a unified infrastructure platform based on the technical, traffic and ecological resources, and will be gradually open to the blockchain industry. It will make the construction of decentralized applications more efficient and cost-effective, and provide comprehensive empowerment in aspects of promotion, traffic, and resources. The Circle Layer Blockchain Platform is an EVM compatible blockchain who solves the biggest problem of Dapp industry. The Circle Layer Blockchain Platform will provide global developers with series of diverse innovative facilities and services.

## Solving market's biggest problem
The blockchain industry's most significant application lies in decentralized applications (Dapps) functioning on various blockchains. However, the operational efficiency of these Dapps, particularly in high-demand sectors like gaming, metaverse, and NFTs, is critically hindered by the limited transaction speeds offered by conventional blockchain technology. This constraint often forces Dapps to contemplate abandoning blockchain in favor of centralized web applications to achieve their full operational potential.

Our blockchain solution directly addresses this issue by integrating a robust Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, enabling a high transaction per second (TPS) capacity. This enhancement not only accelerates transaction processing but also fortifies network security through a dedicated network of validators responsible for transaction verification. Such advancements in speed and security are instrumental in empowering Dapps to continue their innovative pursuits within the blockchain ecosystem without compromise.

Additionally, our blockchain technology addresses a prevalent financial challenge faced by Dapp developers: inadequate cash flow. Despite high user engagement and transaction volumes, Dapp developers often see little financial return, as transaction fees are traditionally accrued by miners or stakers in Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains. This dynamic exacerbates the financial disparity within the industry. Our innovative solution redistributes a portion of transaction fees to smart contract deployers, thereby generating a positive cash flow for Dapp developers. This strategic reallocation ensures a more equitable financial ecosystem, enabling developers to sustain their projects and continue their innovative contributions to the blockchain landscape..

## Declaration
To empower the decentralized applications (Dapps) ecosystem 

## Vision
Circle Layer Blockchain's vision is not only to be the best public blockchain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, Circle Layer Blockchain is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## Circle Layer Blockchain's Performance
- TPS: 2000
- Average block interval: "3s"

## Consensus Mechanism
DPoS consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

## Economic Model 
The endogenous token on the chain is CLAYER; the transactions consume CLAYER as gas fee.

Miners pledge CLAYER to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion. 

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as ETH, BNB and stable coins can be mapped to Circle Layer Blockchain by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on Circle Layer Blockchain. 

Circle Layer Blockchain encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.  

## Circle Layer Blockchain Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.

## Support Plan of Circle Layer Blockchain
### Financial Support
- Circle Layer Blockchain will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
- Circle Layer Blockchain will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers. 
- In order to reduce the cost of users on Circle Layer Blockchain Dapp, the Circle Layer Blockchain meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding CLAYER in a step-wise manner.

### Traffic Support
Circle Layer Blockchain will strongly support the development of Circle Layer Blockchain ecosystem:
- Provide traffic entrance for high-quality Dapp on Circle Layer Blockchain.
- After running successfully on Circle Layer Blockchain, high-quality projects can submit token listing application to Circle Layer Blockchain trading platform, and can be listed on it if they meet the listing standards.

### Resource Support
- Projects or developers that have received investment and support from Circle Layer Blockchain have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
- High-quality projects can participate in Circle Layer Blockchain foundation roadshows for free.
- Circle Layer Blockchain will open up ecological resources to high-potential developers, matching the win-win cooperation between developers and our ecological partners.
